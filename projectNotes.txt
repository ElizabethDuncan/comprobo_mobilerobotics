make of stating position of neato

connect to neato
roslaunch neato_2dnav hector_mapping_neato.launch
rosrun rviz rviz
rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py


after getting complete map:
rosrun  map_server map_saver -f ~/mymap2


changed fixed frame to map (instead of odom)
add (bottom of page), by topic, map

turn down linear and angular speep until linear 0.1



plug planner into "movbase"
write python ros node that takes in map (mymap.pgm) and intial position and goal position
generate sequences of directions


to run the neato based on the map:
roslaunch neato_simulator neato_tb_playground.launch
roslaunch turtlebot_rviz_launchers view_navigation.launch




map is:
$: rosmsg show nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid 
std_msgs/Header header
  uint32 seq
  time stamp
  string frame_id
nav_msgs/MapMetaData info
  time map_load_time
  float32 resolution
  uint32 width
  uint32 height
  geometry_msgs/Pose origin
    geometry_msgs/Point position
      float64 x
      float64 y
      float64 z
    geometry_msgs/Quaternion orientation
      float64 x
      float64 y
      float64 z
      float64 w
int8[] data

rospy.wait_for_service("static_map")
		static_map = rospy.ServiceProxy("static_map", GetMap)
		try:
			map = static_map().map
		except:
			print "error receiving map"



shut off the neato by going to the file and then:
./shutdown_pi.sh
